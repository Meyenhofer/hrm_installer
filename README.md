Detailed steps
--------------

These are the steps performed by the installation script in more detail.

1. Check for HuCore installation and get installation path.
2. Check for missing dependencies and try to install those packages. If a
   database management system, either MySQL or PostgreSQL, is missing you have
   to choose one.
3. Configuration of missing packages through system's package manager.
4. Creation of HRM's system account, database account and database for chosen
   DBMS. You have to provide or set account names and passwords.
5. Installation and configuration of HRM. The latest version will be downloaded
   or you may offer an offline ZIP file. You have to provide the installation
   path and an image data storage path.
6. Setup of web server, configuring PHP, creating the database and running the
   HRM queue manager as system daemon.
7. Setting all necessary access permissions. The apache web server user will
   become member of the hrmgroup, the queue manager is run as hrmuser, and the
   image data storage directory's group is set to hrmgroup with sticky bit
   enabled. For Fedora and CentOS also the required SELinux rules are set.
